# 🪐 Pictures from Space
Pictures from Space contains a wonderful collection of photographs from NASA. The first section shows a random selection of Astronomy photos taken from the Astronomy Picture of the Day website. This site has shown a space-related photo or video every day since 1995. According to NASA, the Astronomy Picture of the Day website is the most popular government website in the United States. When you click on a picture, you get to read additional information about the picture and you can also download it. The second section on the Pictures from Space website shows Mars rover photos. Here, a random sol (a day on mars) is selected and the first photo from that is shown. On the details page of a rover you can read more about the launch and landing date of the rover and view all the pictures of that day. This site also shows the pictures taken by the MARS2020 Perseverance rover.  

**About this project**
<br>
This project is part of the Web Apps form Scratch course at CMD, part of the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences. In this course we will learn how to create a single page web application without the use of frameworks or unnecessary libraries. So with vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Data is loaded from our own chosen external API and then displayed in the interface.

## 💡 Concept idea

Prior to developing my final product, I first thought about a suitable concept and a matching API. Eventually, I ended up with the NASA API. Based on the available data, I then made a choice for which API endpoints I would develop my concept. The choice fell on the Astronomy Picture of the Day and Mars rover dataset. I then created sketches and then a digital sketch.

## 📊 Data

The data that I am using for my concept comes from NASA. I am using two different API endpoints. The first API contains data from the "Astronomy Picture of the Day" website. The second API contains data from "Mars Rover Photos". Below I have posted an overview of the data contained in these APIs:

**From the "Astronomy Picture of the Day" dataset:**

- `copyright`: information about the person or organization that has a copyright on this image (if applicable), example output: `"Eddie Guscott"`
- `date`: the date the picture was featured as Astronomy Picture of the Day (formatted as YYYY-MM-DD), example output: `"2004-05-11"`
- `explanation`: an explanation about the picture, example output: `"M13 is one of the most prominent..."`
- `hdurl`: link to the HD version of the image, example output:`"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0405/m13_guscott_big.jpg"`
- `title`: title of the image., example output: `"M13: The Great Globular Cluster in Hercules"`
- `url`: link to the image (lower quality version), example output:`"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0405/m13_guscott.jpg"`

**From the "Mars Rover" dataset:**

- `max_sol`: maximum available sol (date on mars) for which data on the rover is available. Example output: `4` 
- `img_src`: link to the image taken by the Mars Rover, example output: `"http://mars.nasa.gov/msl-raw/FRB_665678231EDR_F341M_.JPG"`
- `earth_date`: the date the picture was taken, based on earth dates (formatted as YYYY-MM-DD), example output: `"2004-05-11"`
- `camera`: an object with information about which rover camera took the picture, example output: `{full_name: "Front Hazard Avoidance Camera", name: "FHAZ"}`
- `rover`: an object with information about the rover that took the picture, example output:`{landing_date: "2012-08-06", launch_date: "2011-11-26", name: "Curiosity", status: "active"}`

## 👨‍🎨 Actor Diagram
The actor diagram shows 'who' handles the functionality of the application. It shows the components that are used to create this app and what their relations are.
